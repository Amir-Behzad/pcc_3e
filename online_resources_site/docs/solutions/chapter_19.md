# Solutions - Chapter 19

## 19-1: Blog

Start a new Django project called `Blog`. Create an app called `blogs`, with one model that represents an overall blog, and one model that represents an individual blog post. Give each model an appropriate set of fields. Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a blog and a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in an appropriate order.

Create pages for making a blog, for making new posts, and for editing existing posts. Use your pages to make sure they work.
