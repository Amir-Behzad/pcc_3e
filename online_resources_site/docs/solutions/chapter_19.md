# Solutions - Chapter 19

---

## 19-1: Blog

Start a new Django project called `Blog`. Create an app called `blogs`, with one model that represents an overall blog, and one model that represents an individual blog post. Give each model an appropriate set of fields. Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a blog and a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in an appropriate order.

Create pages for making a blog, for making new posts, and for editing existing posts. Use your pages to make sure they work.

## 19-2: Blog Accounts

Add a user authentication and registration system to the `Blog` project you started in Exercise 19-1 (page 415). Make sure logged-in users see their username somewhere on the screen and unregistered users see a link to the registration page.
